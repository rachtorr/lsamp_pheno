# NEON phenology forecasting student research project 

Material used for Spring 2025 Undergraduate Student Research Projects - funded by the Sloan Foundation in partnership with [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/) - at Cal Poly Humboldt and University of New Mexico Gallup. 

Our goal was for students to do a NEON phenology forecasting challenge over the course of a semester. Students went through the entire cycle, downloading data, exploring and visualizing, formatting data for models, and testing linear models. Individual sites, selected by students, have separate folders named by site code within the [NEON_sites_Spr25](https://github.com/rachtorr/lsamp_pheno/tree/main/NEON_sites_Spr25) tab.

The workflows in [NEON_workflows](https://github.com/rachtorr/lsamp_pheno/tree/main/NEON_workflows) were written for students to follow along, and edited using student feedback.
